    """Tree Node. Contains the ast_type and all its attributes and children are stored in children.

    A visual representation of helloworld.json would look like this:

    Module--------------------
    attr:body (array of nodes)
    |
    Expr------
    attr:value
    |
    Call-------------------------------------
    attr:args                       attr:func
    |                               |
    Constant------------------      Name----
    attr:value = "Hello World"      attr:ctx
                                    |
                                    Load----

    We have a Module root node which contains an array of nodes. In this case, only one - an Expr node. One of the attributes of an Expr node is value,
    which stores another node, this time of type Call. Call has an attribute args, which contains an array of nodes (in this case, also only one) - Constant.
    Constant has an attribute called value which holds "Hello World".

    - Should we discard ast_type-specific naming for the children? Instead of body/value/argues should it just be a Node attribute called "children"? Or
    is it relevant for the problem? -> No, we should not. A Call node (for example) has children in attr:args and attr:func. We can't merge.
    - We must handle these main node types, and its nestings:
        * Expr
        * Assign
        * If
        * While

    Anything other than these is extra (as per project presentation)
