    To identify potentially dangerous data flows that can lead to XSS! and CSRF! defects

    is the first mechanism to consider framework-specific elements in its analysis
        involved the particular features of Django-based applications e.g. templates.
    ----intro
    Such frameworks include by default security features 
    However, on many occasions developers need to disable such features to allow for specific functionalities.

    To address such problems, we have developed Pythia,
    a mechanism that analyzes Django-based applications to identify potentially
    dangerous data paths. 
    To do so, it checks if dangerous code constructs (i.e. the ones used to bypass the security checks provided by the framework) are included in an application. 
    Then, by performing data-flow analysis it examines all critical application parts to
    identify if any data that may incorporate user input reaches the
    constructs identified in the first step.

    Our mechanism borrows some of the standard ideas (Abstract
    Syntax Tree (ast) analysis) and terms (sources and sinks) of other
    data-flow analysis and taint tracking schemes.
    But it also takes into account the complicated architecture
    and the various mechanisms (inheritance) and features (templates)
    of Django-based applications
    ----django
    A serious issue emerges when this bypassing happens in templates, a feature that provides a way to generate html dynamically.
    Templates are supported by several frameworks including Django
    and Laravel. In general, templates contain static parts of the desired
    html output, together with some special syntax describing how
    the dynamic content will be inserted.
    To track such a vulnerability is not trivial because templates can
    either include or inherit other templates
    ----approach
    To do so, Pythia analyzes an applicationâ€™s views and templates, leaving out models as they do
    not hold any relevant information (Model Template View). Figure 2 presents the basic steps
    performed by our approach: First, Pythia searches for specific constructs, which we call sinks, marking any affected templates and
    then, examines views to identify (1) if untrusted data can reach the
    elements identified in the first step, (2) if other sinks are being used by the views.
    --sinks 
    A sink method depicts a coding construct where the hazard might
    take place. In our case, a sink involves an invocation that
    bypasses the default security mechanisms of a Django Application.
    In such an application we can divide sinks into two categories,namely: in-view sinks, and template sinks
    In-view sinks only affects a particular View, 
    While template sinks may affect all the views that use those templates

    Template sinks are filters like safeseq/safe, results in not filtering out dangerous characters and marking variables as safe 
    In view sinks like @csrf_exempt, can lead to XSS

    To trace dangerous data flows, Pythia expects as input two lists which in turn include the constructs of each category
        two lists, one containing in view sinks and other template sinks

    When Pythia identifies a sink, it then examines the application
    for potential sources,
    --analysis
    First, our approach retrieves all project templates and generates their corresponding Abstract Syntax Trees (asts). Then,
    starting from the root node of each ast, it recursively traverses all
    children nodes searching for variables that reach a sink method.
    Specifically, when Pythia identifies a sink, it marks the template as potentially dangerous
    If the current template extends or includes another one, the approach goes on to examine the other
    template too. In this way it creates a path that is recorded when a sink is found
